# Minesweeper

Hello! This is a simple Minesweeper clone I made to learn C++. Note that this repo is for the version with a UI created using QT. For the text-based version, click [here](https://github.com/Derbzzzzzz/Minesweeper).

## Deployment

This repo contains two main "sections". The root with the files for the game (.cpp and .h files) is one section. 

The other section is the subfolder "debug" which contains the deployed version of the app. Go into the "debug" folder and run "Minesweeper.exe" to play the game (not sure if it works on non-windows computers).
